# Auto-Regressive-Model-Fitting-with-Gradient-Descent
A time series analysis project focusing on fitting auto-regressive (AR) models using regular and stochastic gradient descent methods. The analysis involves estimating parameters, comparing gradient descent techniques, and examining the impact of different learning rates on model convergence for two datasets.
